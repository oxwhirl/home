I am a DPhil student in Engineering Science at the [University of Oxford](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/) in the [FLAIR](https://foersterlab.com/) and [WhiRL](https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/) labs, co-supervised by Professor [Jakob Foerster](https://www.jakobfoerster.com/) and Professor [Shimon Whiteson](https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/pages/people/shimon.html). I am funded by the [Clarendon Fund Scholarship](https://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon) in partnership with a Department of Engineering Science Studentship.

I received my BS in Computer Science with Honors and Distinction at [Stanford University](https://cs.stanford.edu) (2020-2024), where I was also a member of Professor [Dorsa Sadigh](https://dorsa.fyi)'s [ILIAD](https://iliad.stanford.edu/) lab since my sophomore year.

I am interested in creating AI agents that can interact with their environment and safely work alongside humans and other autonomous agents, with a growing focus on integrating natural language into AI coordination. My research broadly spans three subfields of computer science:

- Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Enabling independently trained agents to cooperate on a common task and form conventions.

- Vision: Capturing meaningful information about an agent's environment from sensors.

- Graphics: Simulating environments while balancing speed and realism.
