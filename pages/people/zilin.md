I am a DPhil student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford, under the supervision of Professor Shimon Whiteson. My research focuses on developing general decision-making systems capable of interacting with complex, dynamic environments. Currently, I am exploring Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) as a core solution methodology.

I hold a Master’s degree from Tsinghua University and a Bachelor’s degree from Dalian University of Technology.
