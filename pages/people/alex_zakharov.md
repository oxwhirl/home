My name is Alex, and I am a DPhil (PhD) student at the Whiteson Research Lab, where I am supervised by [Prof Shimon Whiteson](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/shimon.whiteson/).

I am interested in building adaptive agents that can safely navigate complex environments to achieve desired outcomes. To this end, I am focussed on the framework of Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning. I believe it provides the natural basis for building robust and adaptive artificial agents that can deal with stochastic and partially-observable environments. More specifically, my research has been dedicated to creating better world models (latent-variable generative modelling) and model-based agents with Bayesian planning objectives. 

Previously, I worked as a research associate at Huawei 2012 Laboratories in London, focussing on Bayesian model-based RL, representation learning, and generative models. I hold a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Imperial College London, where I was supervised by [Dr. Zafeirios Fountas](http://www.zfountas.com) and [Dr. Matthew Crosby](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TjfMUmkAAAAJ&hl=en).
